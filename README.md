- 👋 Hi, I’m **@hasnainfazili**, a passionate Game Designer and Developer specializing in AI systems, multiplayer mechanics, and immersive gameplay experiences.  
- 👀 I’m interested in **exploring new game development methodologies, creating dynamic AI-driven systems, and building multiplayer games with PvP and PvE integration.** I also enjoy experimenting with gesture-based interactions using **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV** in Unity.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **advanced machine learning techniques for AI in games and diving deeper into real-time multiplayer networking for large-scale games.**  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **innovative indie game projects, especially those that push the boundaries of player interaction, AI-driven gameplay, or offer unique multiplayer experiences.**
